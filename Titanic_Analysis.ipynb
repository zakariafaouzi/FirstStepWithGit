    "### Introduction to Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing is the heart of any machine learning pipeline, capable of magnifying accuracy when done right or leading to poor performance when overlooked. The quality of the output of any machine learning model is directly proportional to the quality of input data. Hence the Golden Rule, \"Garbage In, Garbage Out.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the goal of data preprocessing is to cleanse, transform, and format the raw data into a structure that makes it ready for machine learning algorithms. Choosing the right techniques under preprocessing often depends on the specifics of your data, as such, there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The section today works like an introduction to this broad ocean of skills and sets the foundation for how you'll approach datasets in ensuing lessons.\n",

    "### Overview of the Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Having understood the concept of preprocessing, it's time to roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty with the Titanic dataset. We aim to understand the data structure and its characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic dataset comes pre-packaged in the Seaborn library, a visualization library in Python. Let's go ahead and load the dataset."
